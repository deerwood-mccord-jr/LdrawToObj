LdrawToObj
==========

Converts LDraw model files to OBJ.

What needs to be done:

1: Custom color support, for example color #432112.
    a) add Color object
    b) it should create <modelfilename>.mtl for custom colors. ldrawcolors.mtl remain place to store standard colors.
    

2:) Remove useless project from source. I refactored in middle of development to make it function better but left now useless files.
